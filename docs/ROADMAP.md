## M0 — Foundation

Project skeleton and shared vocabulary. Nothing here is user-facing, but every later milestone
depends on the tokens and structure being right.

- [x] `README.md`, `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/API.md`, `docs/DATA-MODEL.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- [x] `.gitignore`
- [x] `git init`
- [x] Expo SDK 57 + TypeScript (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) scaffold
- [x] expo-router with the 4-tab + center-action shell (custom `TabBar`, hand-drawn SVG icons)
- [x] Nativewind v4 + `src/theme/` tokens, single-sourced from `palette.js`
- [x] **Domain hex values sampled from Riot's Basic Rune card art**, re-derived in OKLCH
      (`scripts/sample-domain-colors.ts`)
- [x] Fonts loaded (Space Grotesk + Inter — see `DESIGN.md` §3 for why not Rajdhani)
- [x] ESLint + Prettier + Vitest configured
- [x] npm scripts: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `seed`, `db:generate`

**Done when:** `npx expo start` boots to the tab skeleton on a physical device, and `npm run
typecheck` + `npm run lint` pass clean. ✅ — plus `npx expo export --platform android` produces a
6.41 MB Hermes bundle.

> **Toolchain note.** `babel-preset-expo` must match the installed SDK. A mismatch targets a
> different Hermes and stops transpiling ES6 classes, which the bundled `hermesc` may not parse —
> `expo export` then fails with "invalid statement encountered" at the bytecode step. This bit once
> during M0 when the preset resolved a version ahead of the SDK. `npx expo install --fix` realigns
> it, and `npx expo-doctor` catches it before a build does.
>
> **Upgraded to SDK 57 (2026-08-06).** Originally scaffolded on 54, which was three releases behind
> by the time M1 landed. The upgrade surfaced a latent bug: `TabBar.tsx` imported
> `BottomTabBarProps` from `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`, an *undeclared* dependency that resolved
> only because npm hoisted it out of expo-router's tree. expo-router v7 vendors its own copy of
> those types, so two incompatible definitions collided. The type is now derived from expo-router's
> own `Tabs` component, and a sweep confirmed no other phantom dependencies exist.

## M1 — Card data

The foundation everything else reads from. Ships the first genuinely useful screen.

- [x] Zod schemas validating every API response at the boundary (`schemas.ts`)
- [x] Riftcodex client with timeouts, capped retries, and backoff (`client.ts`)
- [x] Drizzle schema for `cards`, `sets`, `sync_meta` + FTS5 virtual table and triggers
      (`migrations.ts`, applied by `PRAGMA user_version`)
- [x] `scripts/generate-seed.ts` → `assets/seed/cards.json` (1,451 cards, 1.64 MB)
- [x] Sync engine: seed load → set-change detection → sequential paging → 24 h TTL guard
- [x] `src/lib/cdn.ts` image transform presets (`thumb` / `card` / `full`)
- [x] **Card gallery** — FlashList grid, domain rail, filter modal with live result count, FTS search
- [x] **Card detail** — pinch and double-tap zoom, rules text, card-footer metadata line
- [x] Unit tests for the API mapper (10 passing)

**Done when:** all 1,451 cards browse and filter offline in airplane mode, search returns results as
you type, and the grid scrolls at 60 fps on a mid-range Android device.

### Post-M1 audit (2026-08-06)

Traced end to end against a real SQLite database (Node 24's `node:sqlite` shimmed to the expo-sqlite
interface, running the real `migrate()` and the real query SQL). Six defects found and fixed:

| # | Defect | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `hydrate()` cast raw `SELECT *` rows straight to `CardRow`. SQLite returns snake_case; the type is camelCase | **12 of 29 fields were `undefined`, including `imageUrl` — every card rendered without art.** Also killed rules text, set code, collector number, and the screen-reader label |
| 2 | `useCardSync()` held per-component state and a per-component "started" ref, but is called from two screens | Two concurrent 15-page walks of a small fan-run API on first launch; refreshing from Profile left the gallery's count stale |
| 3 | Decks empty state linked to `/deck/new`, which did not exist | Both onboarding buttons dead-ended on the "unmatched route" screen |
| 4 | Filter sheet computed its live count from the store's `search`, but the gallery kept search in local state | "Show N cards" ignored the active search term |
| 5 | `relevance` sort mapped to the same expression as `name` | Searching "vi" ranked Vision Quest above Vi |
| 6 | `listSets()` had the same cast bug as #1 | Latent — no UI consumed it yet |

The fix for #1 removes the whole class rather than the instance: column metadata is now derived from
the Drizzle schema (`src/db/queries/hydrate.ts`) and shared by **both** the read path and the write
path, which had its own hand-written column list. `hydrate.test.ts` asserts no column resolves to
`undefined`, so a future schema addition cannot silently reintroduce it.

Verified working and unchanged by the audit: migrations and `PRAGMA user_version`, FTS5 including the
update triggers dropping stale terms, the anchored `domain_key` filter, and the sync change-detection
heuristic (`sum(set.card_count)` does equal the `/cards` total, so no needless re-downloads).

### Pre-M2 hardening (2026-08-06)

| Area | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| **Image pipeline** | CDN verified live: serves `image/webp` to Android (Coil) and iOS (SDWebImage) user agents, **no hotlink protection** (foreign `Referer` and absent UA both return 200), `Cache-Control: max-age=31536000`. 789 KB → 11.9 KB confirmed. Decoding by expo-image itself remains device-only |
| **Typing latency** | Measured over the full 1,451-card library. Hydration is **0.79 ms**; SQL dominates at 4.18 ms. Typing gets *cheaper*: `"v"` → 401 rows/1.4 ms, `"vi"` → 58 rows/0.2 ms. Worst case is the unfiltered first render, once. (V8, not Hermes; JSI bridge cost unmeasured) |
| | Fixed real waste: the filter sheet ran the whole query for a count. Now `countMatchingCards()` — a `COUNT(*)` |
| **Domain glyphs** | Unicode placeholders removed entirely. `✷ ⬢ ❋` live in Noto Sans Symbols, not Roboto, so a thin-font device would have rendered tofu — silently dropping half of "color never carries meaning alone". Replaced with drawn SVG (`components/cards/DomainGlyph.tsx`) |
| | Every remaining non-ASCII character (`•` `—` `…`) confirmed present in the bundled Space Grotesk and Inter by reading each font's cmap table |
| **Migrations** | Real upgrade-path tests added (`migrations.test.ts`), running actual DDL against `node:sqlite` |

**The migration test found a shipping bug immediately.** FTS5 triggers only fire on writes made after
they exist, so a device upgrading v1 → v2 with a populated card mirror got an **empty search index** —
and because sync skips entirely when the mirror is already complete, nothing would ever rebuild it.
Search would return nothing, silently and permanently. Migration 2 now backfills the index itself
rather than depending on a later call.

The suite is parameterised over `MIGRATIONS`, so **v3 gets a populated-database upgrade test the
moment M2 adds it**, with no new test code.

> ### ⚠️ Not yet run on a device — no emulator available
>
> Every check so far is typecheck, unit tests, Node-level traces against real SQLite, and a Metro
> bundle. **No pixel has been rendered.** This machine has the Android SDK but no JDK, no system
> image, and no AVD, so booting one would mean installing a JDK and downloading ~1.5 GB first.
>
> To run it: `npm run seed && npx expo start`, then Expo Go. What to look at first:
>
> 1. **Do card images appear?** The CDN is proven, expo-image's webp decode is not. Blank tiles here
>    would be a *different* cause than the hydration bug fixed in the audit — check the URL in a
>    browser before assuming a regression.
> 2. **Typing lag in the gallery.** Expected imperceptible; the risk is the first unfiltered render.
> 3. **The six domain glyphs** in the filter rail — all should be solid shapes, no boxes.
> 4. **The tab bar's `+` button** uses `marginTop: -22` to overhang the bar; Android sometimes clips
>    children overflowing a parent with elevation.
>
> **Still unverified:** the 60 fps target and offline behaviour need a physical device — everything
> above was checked by typecheck, unit tests, and a full Metro bundle only. First device run should
> confirm scroll performance with all 1,451 cards and that airplane mode still browses.
>
> Two deferred items: TS types are hand-written from the OpenAPI spec rather than codegen'd (the
> spec is small and stable enough that a generator earns nothing yet), and the filter panel is a
> router modal rather than a gesture sheet — the log-match flow in M4 is the one that genuinely
> needs a draggable sheet, and that is where `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` gets introduced.

## M2 — Decks

- [ ] Drizzle schema for `decks`, `deck_versions`, `deck_version_cards`
- [ ] `src/lib/legality.ts` — all rules from `API.md` §7, pure and unit-tested
- [ ] Create flow: Legend → Champion → build
- [ ] Deck editor: zone-grouped list, steppers, identity-filtered card rail
- [ ] Live legality bar with specific failure reasons
- [ ] Deck detail: Overview | List | Versions | Matches | Stats
- [ ] Decks tab with accent-gradient deck cards

**Done when:** a legal 40 + 12 + 3 deck can be built end to end, illegal states report the precise
reason, and illegal decks still save.

---

## M3 — Versioning

The core mechanic. Correctness here determines whether every number in the app is trustworthy.

- [ ] `src/lib/deck-diff.ts` — pure diff engine + `suggestLabelFromDiff()`
- [ ] `locked_at` set on first match
- [ ] Fork-on-save for locked versions; amend-in-place for unlocked
- [ ] **No-op guard** — identical save creates nothing
- [ ] Amend escape hatch behind a consequence-stating confirm
- [ ] Editor banner on locked versions
- [ ] Diff-led save sheet with pre-filled label
- [ ] **Version timeline** with per-version records and diff chips
- [ ] **Compare mode** (long-press two versions)

**Done when:** the invariants in `DATA-MODEL.md` §3 all hold under test — especially that a no-op
save creates no version, and that a version with matches is never silently mutated.

---

## M4 — Matches

- [ ] Drizzle schema for `matches`, `match_games`, `events`
- [ ] Log-match sheet: deck selector, WIN/LOSS, recent-opponent chip rail
- [ ] "Add details" expander: on play/draw, BO3 strip, event, mulligans, tags, notes
- [ ] Undo toast with live record readout
- [ ] "Log another" for consecutive rounds
- [ ] Match list, detail, and edit
- [ ] Haptics throughout

**Done when:** a stopwatch confirms **under 10 seconds** from tab bar to confirmation toast. If it's
slower, the flow gets redesigned before moving on.

---

## M5 — Analytics

- [ ] `src/lib/analytics/` — win rate, Wilson CI, splits, streaks, rolling series
- [ ] `compareVersions()` with `inconclusive` verdict and `matchesNeeded`
- [ ] Deck stats screen
- [ ] Version comparison view
- [ ] Matchup matrix
- [ ] Charts: rolling win rate, win-rate bars with CI whiskers, sparklines
- [ ] Cross-deck Stats tab
- [ ] Provisional styling below n = 20 applied everywhere

**Done when:** no screen can display a win rate without its sample size and interval, and a
comparison of two small samples refuses to declare a winner.

*This completes the usable product. Everything below is expansion.*

---

## M6 — Extras

In priority order — each is independently shippable.

- [ ] **Deck import/export** — parse pasted decklists (via `/cards/name?fuzzy=`), export as text and share code
- [ ] **Collection tracker** — `collection` table, owned counts, "missing cards" flags in the builder
- [ ] **Goldfish** — draw sample opening hands from a version, mulligan simulation
- [ ] **Event mode** — group matches into tournaments with rounds and final placement

Import lands first: it's the fastest path from install to a user who has something to track.

---

## M7 — Cloud

- [ ] Supabase project, schema migrations mirroring the local tables
- [ ] RLS policies (`auth.uid() = user_id`) on every table
- [ ] Auth: email, Sign in with Apple, Google
- [ ] Sync engine: pull-then-push, last-write-wins on `updated_at`, soft-delete propagation
- [ ] Sign-in **claims** existing local data rather than replacing it
- [ ] Sync status and manual trigger in Profile
- [ ] Conflict and offline-queue handling

**Done when:** two devices converge to the same state after concurrent offline edits, and a
signed-out user who signs in keeps every deck and match they already had.

---

## M8 — Ship

- [ ] Motion and haptics polish pass
- [ ] All empty states designed and implemented
- [ ] First-run onboarding
- [ ] Accessibility pass — contrast, 44pt targets, screen reader labels (use `accessibility_text`
      from the API for cards), Dynamic Type, reduce-motion
- [ ] Attribution / disclaimer screen
- [ ] Error boundaries and crash reporting
- [ ] EAS Build + EAS Update pipeline
- [ ] App icon, splash, store screenshots and copy
- [ ] Privacy policy
- [ ] TestFlight / Play internal testing

---

## Backlog

Deliberately deferred — revisit after launch with real usage data.

- Meta aggregation across users (needs a user base; privacy design required first)
- Price tracking via the TCGPlayer / Cardmarket IDs the API exposes
- Web export of the Expo codebase
- Deck sharing between users
- Sideboard / tech-card tracking as a first-class concept
- Widgets and watch app for ultra-fast logging
